# Frontend-StagingIFrame
Proxy IFrame from OpenShift staging Infrastructure to staging.sayonika.moe

## Testing

Just run this on any HTTP server ran locally, jekyll can work as well.

You'll need a working Sayonika instance to use this. By default we routed this to `staging.sayonika.moe`.

## Deploying

Any static site provider would do, We recommend [Now](https://now.sh) and [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
